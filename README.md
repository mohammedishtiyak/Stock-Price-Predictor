# Stock-Price-Predictor
This is a project that predicts the stock price of a given company using a machine learning model. The project uses historical stock price data to train a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is then used to make predictions on future stock prices. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras, and the web app is built using Streamlit.

## Usage
To use the stock price predictor, simply enter the ticker symbol of the company you want to predict in the text input box on the Streamlit app.
